        <p>This project was built using AWS Amplify, React, Vite, and Typescript. AWS S3 was used for file storage and IAM was used for access policies. The navbar is a customized Bootstrap library component.</p>
        <p>I chose this project to learn more about cloud services and practice creating secure applications while showcaseing my ability to create user-friendly websites with clean and functional designs. </p>
        <p>I learned how to create user roles and policies in AWS and set up bucket policies in S3. Amplify made setting up user authentication and running deployments a breeze.</p>
        <h4>Focus on Security</h4> 

      <ul>
    
    <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong>
      
        <li>All files are protected using AWS S3â€™s server-side encryption, applying advanced encryption standards to data at rest. Data is transmitted securely via HTTPS, preventing unauthorized access during upload and download.</li>
      
    </li>

    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong>
      
        <li>User access is managed through AWS IAM, allowing only authenticated users to upload or retrieve files.
       AWS Amplify manages user authentication, securing file access based on user permissions.</li>
    
    </li>

    <li><strong>Fine-Grained Access:</strong>
      
        <li>Strict bucket policies provide customized, secure access.</li>
      
    </li>
  </ul>
