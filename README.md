## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Bootstrap and custom CSS
- AWS Amplify
- AWS S3
- AWS IAM

## Focus on Security

- **Data Encryption:**
  - All files are protected using AWS S3â€™s server-side encryption, applying advanced encryption standards to data at rest. Data is transmitted securely via HTTPS, preventing unauthorized access during upload and download.

- **Access Control:**
  - User access is managed through AWS IAM, allowing only authenticated users to upload or retrieve files. AWS Amplify manages user authentication, securing file access based on user permissions.
